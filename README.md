# Zip_unlock, can i hack my own zips?

Written in Python 3.

To run navigate to the code directory run the following:
```
python zip_unlock.py dir/to/.zip wordlist.txt
```

Includes a .ipynb (jupyter notebook interactive python format).
To view that file you need jupyter notebook/jupyter lab which you can get by downloading Anaconda python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

So I rejigged the zip_unlock.py and it works much faster than it used to (feel free to check it against an older commit)... I don't know exactly what I did.
